# Java Features

### This repository contains the following Java features:

#### 1. Java 17 features:
##### - Sealed classes
Sealed classes restrict which other classes or interfaces may extend or implement them, providing more control over the class hierarchy.

##### - Pattern matching for switch
Pattern matching for switch enhances the switch statement and expression, allowing it to match patterns instead of just constant values.

##### - Random Number Generators
New interfaces and implementations for random number generators provide a more flexible and powerful framework for generating random numbers.

#### 2. Java 21 features:
##### - Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) API
The KEM API provides a standard way to perform key encapsulation, which is a cryptographic technique used to secure symmetric keys.

##### - Record patterns
Record patterns allow for deconstructing record values in pattern matching, making it easier to work with records.

##### - Sequenced Collections
Sequenced collections introduce new collection types that maintain the order of elements, providing more predictable iteration.

##### - String templates (preview)
String templates offer a new way to create and format strings, making it easier to embed expressions within string literals.

##### - Virtual Threads
Virtual threads are lightweight threads that make it easier to write scalable concurrent applications by reducing the overhead associated with traditional threads.

#### 3. Java 22 features:
##### - Gatherer
The Gatherer API provides a way to collect and process data streams in a more flexible and efficient manner.

##### - Scoped values
Scoped values allow for safely and efficiently sharing values across methods without using method parameters, offering an alternative to thread-local variables.


### How to run the code:
1. Clone the repository
2. In IntelliJ, Configure each one of the classes with a main method as a Java Application. 
   Do not forget to add the --enable-preview flag to the VM options.
